AsteriskBundle
=============

The `AsteriskBundle` provides integration of the [Asterisk PAMI](https://github.com/ryzhov/PAMI)
library into the Symfony2 framework.

To install you can just require `"ryzhov/asterisk-bundle": "~1.0-dev"` in your composer.json
and Composer will automatically pick the latest dev version of the bundle that works with
your current version of Symfony. The minimum version of Symfony2 for this workflow
is 2.3.0.
